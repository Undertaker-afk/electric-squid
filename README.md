# electric-squid

A wrapper and proxy to let [flying-squid](https://github.com/PrismarineJS/flying-squid) run in the browser.

electric-squid-proxy (in components/proxy) creates a light NodeJS proxy Minecraft server that translates game packages into WebSocket packages and sends them to connected WebSocket clients.

electric-squid-frontend (in components/client) creates a wrapper and minimal React frontend to enable [flying-squid](https://github.com/PrismarineJS/flying-squid) to run in the browser instead of on a CLI.
